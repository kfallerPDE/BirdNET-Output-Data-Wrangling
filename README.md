# BirdNET-Output-Data-Wrangling
BirdNET is an AI-powered bird sound identifier. I've developed a code that takes CSV outputs from BirdNET and adds additional data (Date, Time, Datetime, Detector ID, etc). Using this code will build a stronger dataset that can be further queried in R and used for analysis.
